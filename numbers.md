## Mathematical Operations
```python
+ # addition
- # subtraction
* # multiplication
/ # division
```
It is important to note that python follows PEMDAS which is the order of operations. 
```python
one = 1 
two = 2 
three = 3

print(one * one) # 1
print(6 / two) # 3
print(three - one) # 2
```
I am assigning values to variables and then I am using that to do some sort of math.
