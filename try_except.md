# Try and Except

- The try-except code block allows us to try to handle errors that may occur.
- This gives us a chance to handle errors and keep the program running.
- Because if the program catches an error, it will close out the program.

## Types of Errors:
```
- TypeError: When you try to do something between to different data types that isn't suppported.
    - print("hi" + 10
