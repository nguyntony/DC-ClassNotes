# Variables!

## What is a variable?

In my own words, a variable is sort of like an empty shelf that we create and we are able to assign some sort of value to it.

#### example 1:
```python
my_name = "tony"
``` 
#### explanation:

- my_name is the name of the variable that is being used
- my_name is 'storing' the string "tony"

___

#### example 2:
if you had a long string that is being used in multiple places of your code, you can assign it to a variable and reuse that variable.
```python
greeting = "hello! how are you doing today?"
```
you will now be able to call greeting whenever needed.

## What can variables store?

Variables can store the different data types in python. So far, I have learned that it can store strings, numbers and booleans.

#### example 3:
```python
string_var = "this is a string"
number_var = 25
boolean_var = True
```
